# Pairs-Game
Coding a JavaScript memory matching game or pairs game.

The logic of the game is simple:
There are a given number of cards on the table facing down. The player needs to find all the pairs. However, you may want to add more difficulty by limiting the number of guesses or by setting a time limit for the game to be finished.
